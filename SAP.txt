1️⃣ SAP
Full form: Systems, Applications, and Products in Data Processing
Purpose: Helps companies run business processes faster and in an integrated way

2️⃣ ERP
Full form: Enterprise Resource Planning
Purpose: Manages all business activities of a company in one system

3️⃣ SAP Architecture (3-tier)
Presentation Layer: User interface (SAP GUI / Fiori)
Application Layer: Processes business logic
Database Layer: Stores all business data

4️⃣ SAP ECC
Full form: Enterprise Core Component
Description: Older SAP ERP system used before S/4HANA
Key: Supports multiple databases (Oracle, DB2, SQL Server)

5️⃣ SAP HANA
Full form: High-Performance Analytic Appliance
Description: In-memory database for fast, real-time processing

6️⃣ Difference: ECC vs S/4HANA
Feature	   ECC	S/4HANA
Database	   Multiple (Oracle, DB2, SQL)         HANA only (in-memory)
Speed	   Slower	                          Very fast / real-time
Data model  Complex, many tables	             Simplified
UI	        SAP GUI	                      Fiori (web/mobile)
Year	        2004	                          2015

7️⃣ SAP S/4HANA
Latest ERP system built on HANA
Simple, fast, real-time
S = Simple, 4 = 4th generation, HANA = in-memory database

8️⃣ SAP Landscape
Definition: Set of SAP systems used to develop, test, and run SAP safely
Systems:
DEV: Development / coding / configuration
QAS: Quality / testing
PRD: Production / live business

9️⃣ Why DEV, QAS, PRD
DEV → develop & configure
QAS → test & validate
PRD → live business operations

🔟 Why move from ECC to S/4HANA
ECC is older, slower, and less efficient
S/4HANA is faster, simpler, and real-time

+The architecture of SAP R/1(Single Tier Architecture) Structure(1972):
SAP r/1 (R means Real time) and 1 means 1-tier architecture.
First version of the software is released in 1972.


Architecture
Single-tier
One system handles:
Presentation
Application
Database

🔹 Advantages
Simple design
Good for small companies
First real-time SAP system

🔹 Disadvantages
No scalability
Poor performance
Not suitable for large organizations
Everything in one system → risky

Why move from R/1 to R/2?
❌ Could not handle large data
❌ No multi-user support
✔ Need for better performance & reliability

+SAP R/2 Architecture

🔹 Architecture
Two-tier
Runs on mainframe computers
Layers:
Presentation + Application (together)
Database (separate)

🔹 Advantages
Better performance than R/1
Supports large enterprises
Stable for mission-critical systems

🔹 Disadvantages
Very expensive (mainframes)
Not user-friendly
Limited flexibility
No open systems support

🔹 Why move from R/2 to R/3?
- High cost
- Difficult to customize
- Old mainframe technology
* Need for flexible, open, client-server system

+SAP R/3 Architecture
Three-tier (Client–Server)

🔹 Architecture
Three-tier (Client–Server)
Layers:
Presentation
Application
Database

🔹 Advantages
Scalable & flexible
Works on open systems
Multi-user support
GUI-based (easy to use)
Foundation for modern SAP

🔹 Disadvantages
Complex compared to R/1
Requires skilled admins
Initially expensive to implement

*R/1 → Simple
*R/2 → Mainframe
*R/3 → Client-Server

******************************
* ABAP Workbench:
  it is a collection of ABAP tools.
  SE38->PROGRAM/REPORT
  SE11->ABAP Dictionsry
  SE37->Function module
  SE24->Class
  SE80->Object Navigator
  SE21-> to create a package
  MM01-> to create the material
  SM30-> to Maintain the Maintenance View Table(Insert,Update,delete,)
  

* Transsaction Code:
  It is a shortcut to access the ABAP workbench tools.
